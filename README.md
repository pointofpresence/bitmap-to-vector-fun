# bitmap-to-vector-fun

Just some experimentation converting 2-bit images to vector form.

[svg2ttf](https://github.com/fontello/svg2ttf) is used to convert the 2-bit images into an SVG font.

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the experiment.

To iterate on the font, run `npm install` followed by `node dev-server.js`.
